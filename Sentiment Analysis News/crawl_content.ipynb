      "The iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max are expected to break a world record, according to two leakers.\n",
      "One tipster from Weibo, a China-based social media website, claims that they have measured the bezels of both iPhone 16 Pro models â and they're set to be the \"narrowest in the world.\"\n",
      "Ice Universe, a well-known bean spiller in the tech space, concurs with this leak. \"My friend confirmed that the iPhone 16 Pro will reduce bezel, surpassing Galaxy S24 to become the world's narrowest bezel mobile phone, which seems to be very close to the dream form.\"\n",
      "The Weibo tipster pointed out that the iPhone 15 Pro models' bezels are about 1.71mm thick, give or take. \n",
      "For the next-generation iPhone series, they are reporting the following measurements:\n",
      "iPhone 16 Pro - 1.2mm\n",
      "iPhone 16 Pro Max - 1.15mm\n",
      "However, I'd suggest you have your grain of salt ready. Last August, shortly before the reveal of the iPhone 15, 9to5Mac claimed that the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max models will sport \"1.5mm bezels\". The outlet even leaned on Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, a respected Apple analyst and leaker, to corroborate the rumor. However, this leak turned out to be false. \n",
      "There was, indeed, a bezel reduction for the iPhone 15 Pro models â but the measurement slash wasn't a record-breaking one.\n",
      "As such, we won't know for sure if these rumors are true until the Cupertino-based tech giant reveals the next-generation iPhones later this year. However, this scuttlebutt does appear to meet Apple's ultra-thin plans for its products. After all, the recently unveiled iPad Pro is Apple's thinnest product ever.\n",

      "In order to file the claim in the iPhone 7 settlement, the device must have been owned anytime between Sept. 16, 2016 and Jan. 3, 2023. The owners of the devices must also have experienced audio issues during that time and complained to Apple or paid to have it repaired or replaced.\n",
      "With this settlement, affected iPhone 7 and 7 Plus owners may receive up to $349 in compensation from Apple. The final hearing for this lawsuit will take place on July 18, 2024. So along as all goes well, the settlement will be paid sometime after that.\n",
      "Itâs worth noting that as part of this lawsuit, Apple doesnât acknowledge there were any audio issues with the iPhone 7 or 7 Plus. The company also doesnât admit to any wrongdoing connected to the case.\n",

      "The iPhone 15 Pro Max is currently rated best overall in our best smartphones list, but the iPhone 16 Pro models are shaping up to be even better. They're not due to launch until September (alongside the standard iPhone 16), but rumours say they'll have better screens, new processors, extra AI skills and even better cameras.\n",
      "We've been monitoring the iPhone rumour mill since the first model launched back in 2007, so we're well versed at picking the nuggets of truth from the masses of hearsay. Here we've rounded up the most prominent rumours concerning the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max.\n",
      "Let's see what Apple has in store.\n",
      "Apple TV 4K 2024: our wishlist\n",
      "Read our iPhone 15 Plus review\n",
      "iPhone 15 vs iPhone 15 Pro: what are the differences?\n",
      "iPhone 16 vs Samsung Galaxy S24: which 2024 flagship are we more excited about?\n",
      "September, in a word. That's when Apple has launched almost every iPhone since the iPhone 5 in 2012 (bar the iPhone X, which launched in November 2017, and 2020's iPhone 12, which was delayed to October due to the pandemic).\n",
      "Here's when the last few models have launched.\n",
      "iPhone 11: 10th September, 2019\n",
      "iPhone 12: 13th October, 2020\n",
      "iPhone 13: 14th September, 2021\n",
      "iPhone 14: 7th September, 2022\n",
      "iPhone 15: 12th September, 2023\n",
      "The Pro models are always announced alongside the standard non-Pro variants, so we expect to see the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max launch this September.\n",
      "Narrowing it down is a bit trickier, but not impossible. The last few iPhones have launched in the second week of September, so we would wager the iPhone 16 Pro will arrive sometime the week beginning 9th September 2024.\n",
      "Because they offer more power and features, the Pro models are more expensive than the standard iPhone models, usually by Â£200-Â£300 / $200-$300. Here's how the current iPhone models compare.\n",
      "iPhone 15: Â£799 / $799 / AU$1499 (128GB); Â£899 / $899 / AU$1699 (256GB); Â£1099 / $1099 / AU$2049 (512GB)\n",
      "iPhone 15 Plus: Â£899 / $899 / AU$1649 (128GB); Â£999 / $999 / AU$1849 (256GB); Â£1199 / $1199 / AU$2199 (512GB)\n",
      "iPhone 15 Pro: Â£999 / $999 / AU$1849 (128GB); Â£1099 / $1099 / AU$2049 (256GB); Â£1299 / $1299 / AU$2399 (512GB); Â£1499 / $1499 / AU$2749 (1TB)\n",
      "iPhone 15 Pro Max: Â£1199 / $1199 / AU$2199 (256GB); Â£1399 / $1399 / AU$2549 (512GB); Â£1599 / $1599 / AU$2899 (1TB)\n",
      "The big question is: will Apple raise prices? The iPhone 16 Pro models are rumoured to have slightly larger screens than their predecessors, which could increase the pressure on Apple to raise prices. The latest iPad Pro is the first with an OLED screen, and is more expensive than the previous model, so these improvements do cost money.\n",
      "On the plus side, the iPhone 15 range didn't hike prices, and the Samsung Galaxy S24 (the iPhone's closest rival) has the same starting price as the iPhone 15. We would imagine any price rise for the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max will be modest.\n",
      "The iPhone 16 Pro models could see one of the biggest screen changes in recent years, according to one rumour.\n",
      "Display analyst Ross Young says both models will grow their displays by 0.2 inches compared to their iPhone 15 range equivalents â so the iPhone 16 Pro will go from 6.1 inches to 6.3, and the iPhone 16 Pro Max from 6.7 inches to 6.9. This is backed up by Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, who is as reliable an Apple source as they come.\n",
      "An increase of 0.2 inches might not sound like much, but the Pro models have been the same size since they were introduced in the form of the iPhone 12 Pro and Pro Max in 2020. It would mean the iPhone 16 Pro Max has the biggest iPhone screen ever.\n",
      "The iPhone 16 and 16 Plus are thought to stay at the same 6.1- and 6.7-inch sizes as their iPhone 15 equivalents. If this rumour is correct, here's how the iPhone 16 range would look (according to Twitter leaker Sonny Dickson).\n",
      "The iPhone 16 Pro models could be more power efficient, thanks to their screens. One rumour says Samsung Display is developing a new material set especially for use in iPhones. M14 tech reportedly replaces the blue fluorescent technology currently used with blue phosphorescence tech, which makes the screen more power efficient than the LTPO displays on current iPhone Pro models. While Korean publication The Elec doesn't specify which 2024 iPhones will feature the technology, you can bet the premium iPhone Pro models will be among them, should it come to pass.\n",
      "Their screens could also be brighter thanks to the same Micro Lens Array (MLA) tech as seen in LG's G4 OLED TV. This uses tiny internal lenses to redirect reflections, increasing the brightness (or maintaining the same brightness but using less power to do so, preserving battery life). But this is far from set in stone â Apple is only considering the tech, according to The Elec, and so could decide against it.\n",
      "What about the new tandem OLED tech that Apple debuted in the OLED iPad Pro? Could the iPhone 16 Pro models offer the same Ultra Retina XDR display, as suggested by Daring Fireball's John Gruber? (This combines the brightness of two OLED panels, delivering 1000 nits of SDR brightness and 1600 nits of peak HDR). The OLED iPhone 15 models already reach brightness levels of around the same as the new iPad Pro, so some think the extra expense wouldn't be worth what would be only a marginal gain in brightness. Having said that, 'marginal gains' has been the byword of new iPhones in recent years, so don't write it off just yet...\n",
      "One tipster reckons the iPhone 16 Pro will be brighter than the new OLED iPad Pro's screen. A Weibo user calling themselves Instant Digital (via MacRumors) says the iPhone 16 Pro's screen will be 20 per cent brighter than the iPhone 15 Pro and new OLED iPad Pro, with standard SDR brightness of 1200 nits. (That would be the first boost in brightness for the iPhone since the iPhone 13 Pro in 2021.) Peak HDR brightness is thought to remain unchanged at 1600 nits.\n",
      "Whichever screen tech Apple opts for, the displays have already been greenlit for production, according to one report. The Elec (via MacRumors) reports that both Samsung Display and LG Display have been granted approval for mass production of the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max's OLED screens. Samsung Display is said to be supplying all four models of iPhone 16, while LG Display is thought to be making screens for only the Pro models.\n",
      "The iPhone 16 Pro models won't have any physical buttons, according to one rumour. In their place will be capacitive touch buttons that will be more resistant to wear and tear. That's according to Chinese news outlet Economic Daily (via AppleInsider), which reports that Apple has given a semiconductor supplier a large order for capacitive buttons. Though given that the report says that production isn't due to ramp up until just before the iPhone 16 launches, we'd take this one with a pinch of salt.\n",
      "Other than that, no major design changes have been rumoured.\n",
      "We could see a better camera on the iPhone 16 Pro, according to respected analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. He reckons the handset will upgrade from the iPhone 15 Pro's 3x optical zoom to the same 5x optical zoom as the iPhone 15 Pro Max (and presumably the iPhone 16 Pro Max too). Though this could make the 16 Pro slightly thicker than the 15 Pro.\n",
      "And the 16 Pro Max could get an even better upgrade â a new sensor. A leaker on Chinese social media site Weibo (via MacRumors) says it will boast a new Sony IMX903 sensor instead of the iPhone 15 Pro Max's IMX803 â this will reportedly still be 48MP resolution but should have some as-yet-unknown improvements. The iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max's ultra-wide cameras could also upgrade to 48MP from their current 12MP â quite a jump.\n",
      "A new A18 processor is rumoured for the iPhone 16 range and, as ever, it looks like the Pro models will have a more powerful chip. Analyst Jeff Pu (via MacRumors), reckons the iPhone 16 Pro variants will feature the A18 Bionic Pro, with the non-Pro models running on the standard A18 processor. Pu says the A18 chip will be manufactured with TSMC's 3 nanometer process, and that only power users will see much difference between the performance of the two chips.\n",
      "Still, this would bring all four iPhone 16 models more into alignment. Currently the Pro and non-Pro iPhones feature different-generation chips (A16 Bionic for the iPhone 15 and 15 Plus, A17 Pro for the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max), but giving all handsets in the iPhone 16 range the same-generation chip would seemingly take them closer to parity across the family, especially if the difference is as small as Pu claims. Then again, the difference could be bigger, and giving all iPhone 16 handsets the same-generation chip would certainly send a clearer message to consumers.\n",
      "Artificial intelligence is likely to feature heavily in iOS 18, which is the operating system that will ship with the iPhone 16 range. Mark Gurman predicts that AI will improve \"how both Siri and the Messages app can field questions and auto-complete sentences\"Â .\n",
      "Apple is also reportedly in talks to license Google's Gemini AI technology for use cases like image and text generation. Gemini also powers the AI on Samsung's Galaxy S24, so the two phones could have very similar AI features.\n",
      "The iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max are expected to keep the Action button, but according to MacRumors, it's also thought to come to the non-Pro models. The Action button is in place of the mute switch, and because it's customisable it can enable the phone's torch, camera and a specific Focus mode, among other use cases.\n",
      "We could also see an extra 'Capture' button on the same side as the power button â though at the moment its function is unknown.\n",
      "At present, the Pro models top out at 1TB, but we could see this increase thanks to a new kind of flash memory. DigiTimes says that Quad-Level Cell (QLC) NAND Flash would be an upgrade on Apple's current Triple-Level Cell (TLC) NAND Flash, as it would allow more storage in a smaller physical space. This would mean either higher-capacity storage options (like 2TB) or cheaper existing capacities. But it could also mean slower read and write speeds â Apple could lessen this by customising it, but that would eat into the savings it would make. We can't see customers putting up with worse performance from a new iPhone, so don't count on slower speeds.\n",
      "Given Apple's track record, only a fool would bet against the iPhone 16 Pro being another stunning smartphone. The rumours back this up, pointing to bigger and brighter screens, more power, more advanced cameras and AI smarts up the wazoo.\n",
      "But questions remain. The new iPad Pro is pricier than its predecessor (though that's mostly due to the new OLED screen), and if the iPhone 16 Pro follows suit, it could turn off some potential buyers. Then there's the competition. The Samsung Galaxy S24's AI might be a bit hit and miss, but when it works, it's genuinely useful. If Apple doesn't impress with its first implementation of the tech in its flagship smartphone, it could fall behind in what's widely seen as the next front in the smartphone war.\n",
      "Apple faces competition on other fronts too. The Sony Xperia 1 VI might have jettisoned two of its unique movie-centric features (a 4K resolution and 21:9 aspect ratio), but it still looks like the portable cinema to beat. Apple usually tweaks the movie and music performance of its iPhones (though it invariably fails to advertise the fact), so hopefully the iPhone 16 Pro will be more than a match for Sony's finest.\n",
      "We'll update this feature as more rumours emerge. Roll on September!\n",
